# Composition

I describe myself as a "composer theorist" in the sense of *writing music* inspired by theoretical, structural ideas and doing *music theory research* that self and motivated by questions from composition.

### Wedding music ... with a twist

Two friends have recently got married and asked for (or had forced on them) new pieces for the occasion.
You decide whether that makes them lucky or ... otherwise!
In any case, this is wedding music ... with a twist.

### A Couple of Quartets

A couple of short work for string quartet have popped up recently,
perhaps because of our efforts with the [OpenScore String Quartet](https://musescore.com/openscore-string-quartets) initiative.

*Fantasia on a Pulse* was commissioned for the Fitzwilliam String Quartet's 50th Anniversary and yes there is one founder-member still playing.
Imagine being in the same string quartet for 50 years. What an accomplishment.

*4x4x4x4* was an interesting project which arose as a consequence of preparing the 12-tone serial part of the [Open Music Theory textbook](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/).
I thought that the textbook introduction to serial music would benefit from walking through the creation of a new piece.
It was then selected for performance by the Kalimera Quartet at the [VI International Conference MusMat 2021](https://musmat.org/congresso/2021-2/) (Oct 19, 2021, [video here](https://youtu.be/NKtgcLea8nk?feature=shared&t=1873)).

### New piece + Hensel arrangments for the Marsyas Trio

In 2023, I have the pleasure of working with the
[Marsyas Trio](https://www.marsyastrio.com/)

and on a couple of Hensel arrangements.

More details about the Byrd piece will follow soon.
The trio are busy recording the Hensel arrangements in August 2023 for release in a few months time.
