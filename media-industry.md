# Media and Industry

I'm available for media contact about all of the topics discussed on this site listed here.
I am most often asked for interviews on the subject of “AI composition”, and especially for insight into the “Beethoven X” project which attracted considerable media attention.

## Feature: 'Beethoven X' 

In 2019 Deutsche Telekom commissioned a group of us to create some kind of realisation of Beethoven's plans for a 10th symphony ... using AI.
'Beethoven X' (as it came be to known) was a fascinating project asking timely questions like:
- what AI can accomplish in terms of learning and imitating musical style,
- what kinds of human-computer interactions are possible and desirable.

- the numerous press interviews I and other members of the team gave (details on the request, but a quick internet search is probably effective!)
