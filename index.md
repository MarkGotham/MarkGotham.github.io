Hello!
Mark Gotham here.
Thanks for your interest and visit to this site!
There's a lot of websites out there with partially overlapping information.
This site is a good faith attempt to act as a signpost.
Apart from anything else, it's helpful for me ;)

I'll keep it as succinct as possible, with
few pages,
lots of external links,
and little else!
