# Mark R. H. Gotham, PhD

Thanks for your interest and visit!
There's a lot of websites out there with partially overlapping information.
This site is a good faith attempt to act as a signpost.
I'll keep it as succinct as possible, with
one page,
lost of links,
and little else!

## Short Biography

Mark Gotham specialises in computational methods for music theory, analysis, and composition.
He holds the rare distinction of being appointed to permanent faculty positions in both STEM (now, at Durham) and in the humanities (previously at Dortmund). 
Mark holds a PhD from Cambridge, MMus from the RNCM, and a BA from Oxford (where he graduated at the top of his cohort).

These computer-aided methods can help not only to advance what we know about (a wide range of) musical structures, what we can do with that knowledge, and who can access it.
Central to much of this is the encoding of human analyses in computer-readable formats.
Please see below for links to publications, code and datasets, and public-facing resources.

Beyond his core research, Mark’s work spans commercial contracts, musical composition, and more.
Notable commercial contracts have included the “Beethoven X” project for Deutsche Telekom.
Composition highlights include broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and national Chinese television, and the debut CD of Mark’s compositions (‘Utrumne est Ornatum’, REGCD485) attracting 5-star critical reviews.

Earlier in his career, Mark was a highly active as a performer (singer, multi-instrumentalist, and conductor).
Highlights included conducting principal players of the London Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra in contemporary music projects. 
Moving countries, full-time academic work, the pandemic, and having kids put an end to all that! 

Mark is a committed collaborator, regularly working with scholars at all career stages around the world. 
Prospective students are especially welcome to reach out at any time.

## Media Contact
Available for media contact about all of the topics listed here. I am most often asked for interviews on the subject of “AI composition”, and especially for insight into the “Beethoven X” project which attracted considerable media attention.
