Mark holds a PhD from Cambridge, MMus from the RNCM, and a BA from Oxford (where he graduated at the top of his cohort).

Mark’s research specialises in computational methods for music theory, analysis, and composition.
Computer-aided methods can help not only to advance *what we know* about (a wide range of) musical structures, but also
*what we can do* with that knowledge,
and
*who can access it*.
Central to much of this is the encoding of
*human* analyses in
*computer-readable* formats.

Beyond research, Mark’s work spans commercial contracts, musical composition, and more.
Commercial contracts have included the “Beethoven X” project for Deutsche Telekom.
Composition highlights include broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and national Chinese television, and the debut CD of Mark’s compositions
(_Utrumne est Ornatum_, REGCD485) attracting 5-star critical reviews.

Earlier in his career, Mark was a highly active as a performer (singer, multi-instrumentalist, and conductor).
Highlights included conducting contemporary music projects with principal players of the Philharmonia Orchestra and LSO.

'in between' (now in the [Digital Humanities Department at KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh)).

Mark graduated from the [University of Oxford (Christ Church)](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) with the [Gibbs prize](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/prizes-and-awards/gibbs) for the highest-ranking first class degree awarded in music; from the [Royal Northern College of Music](http://www.rncm.ac.uk/) with an MMus in composition (supported by a full [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/) scholarship); and from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) with a Ph.D. in music theory (Newton Trust scholarship). His thesis was described by the examiners as 'excellent' ([Alan Marsden](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/marsdena/)) and 'formidable' ([Robert Pascall](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/music/people/robert.pascall)).

Mark took up several professional appointments at the University of Cambridge during his PhD, and he remained in Cambridge afterwards to continue and expand that range. These appointments included:

- Affiliated Lecturer in the [Faculty of Music](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/),
- College Lecturer and Director of Music-Making at [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/) where he founded the [Inter Alios Choir](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/societies/music/?q=interalios), and
- Director of Music and Director of Studies in Music at [Murray Edwards College](https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/) where he founded what is now the [Music and Words series](https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/my-medwards/music/music-words-murray-edwards-college-with-inter-alios-choir).
- Running the University’s [choral awards scheme](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/finance/music-awards/choral-awards) (which populates Cambridge’s celebrated collegiate choirs) where he introduced various efficiency measures and also graduate students into the scheme for the first time.

Then he ... 

- ... left Cambridge to take up a unique post as [‘Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Music Theory Pedagogy’ at Cornell University](http://music.cornell.edu/) and fellow of the ['Active Learning Initiative'](http://as.cornell.edu/education-innovation),
- ... returned to Europe in 2020 to take up a second postdoc ('Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter') on the DFG-funded ‘Computergestützte Analyse harmonischer Strukturen’ project (Rainer Kleinertz and Meinard Müller, principal investigators) at the [Universität des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html),
- ... was appointed Professor (W2) of Music Theory at [Technische Universität Dortmund](https://www.musik.tu-dortmund.de/institut/personen/professorinnen-und-professoren/univ-prof-dr-phil-mark-r-h-gotham/).
- ... moved to an Asst. Prof. position in [Computer Science at Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/)) (whlie pursuing the same kind of reserach
- ... before settling on his current position in the [Digital Humanities Department at KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh).

Mark's early career encompassed a wide range of musical activities including performance, composition and arrangement, teaching, and research (including a first post as McCann Research Fellow at the [Royal Academy of Music](https://www.ram.ac.uk/) prior to starting his PhD).
Performance engagements have included playing several instruments, singing (both as a freelance baritone and as a Lay Clerk in the Chelmsford and Ely Cathedral Choirs), and conducting.
As a conductor he worked primarily with student groups through his university roles.
Professional highlights included conducting principals of the [LSO](http://lso.co.uk/) and [Philharmonia Orchestra](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/) in contemporary music projects.

The debut commercial recording of his compositions – [‘Utrumne est Ornatum’](http://www.regent-records.co.uk/product_details_349.htm) – was released by [Regent Records](http://www.regent-records.co.uk/) in 2018, featuring a range of (mostly choral) works and performers including the celebrity guest narrator, [Tom Hollander](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/).
The disc has been highly favourably reviewed by the [Choir and Organ](https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/rhinegold-publishing/magazines/choir-organ/) and [Organists’ Review](https://organistsreview.com/) magazines, with both awarding the maximum 5 stars.
Other composition highlights have included broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and national Chinese television, performances at St Martin in the Fields and the Aldeburgh Festival, and commissions from the King’s Lynn and Thaxted Festivals.
