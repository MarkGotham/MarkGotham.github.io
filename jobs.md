## Let's Work Together!

Thanks for your interest in working together.

First, some notes on what this page does/n't cover:

- This page is for those looking for formal jobs (PhD, postdoc fellowship, faculty position) in the UK.
- If you're in some other position (current student, industry partner, external collaborator etc.) please write directly.
- Most of the advice is not specific to me/KCL, it is UK-wide, but not wider. Please write directly if you want advice on jobs in mainland Europe or elsewhere.

My `kcl.ac.uk` email is in the form `<firstname>.<lastname>`.
Know what I mean ;)?
If you want to demonstrate that you've read this before writing, why not include "Penguins" in the subject.

## Academic Vacancies

Formal vacancies for academic positions (both permanent faculty and temporary postdoctoral research assistants/associates), are advertised in many places.
Typically, our minimum is:

- The Central University webpage for [vacancies at KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/jobs/);
- The UK-wide [jobs.ac.uk/](http://www.jobs.ac.uk/) site
- Discipline specific sites like the [ISMIR community announcements](https://groups.google.com/a/ismir.net/g/community).


## PhD positions

Funded PhD positions arising from specific grants will be advertised as an academic vacancy [(see above)](#academic-vacancies).
Prospective PhD students are also welcome to propose or discuss possible topics at any time. Here are some useful links:

- Advice on [applying to KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/how-to-apply)
- Department specific:
	- [Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh/phd)
	- [Music](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/music) (yes, a PhD can be co-supervised by faculty in different departments)
- [Postgraduate scholarship opportunities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/funding/scholarships-and-studentships)


## (Postdoctoral) Fellowships

Naturally, we support suitable candidates in making applications to relevant schemes that would provide the candidate their own funding.
A good place to start for UK opportunities is 
[https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/).
This site comes with various options to filter for relevance.
Below is a (non-exhaustive list) of options that are:

- familiar to us,
- specifically for postdocs and early-career researchers in areas relevant to our activities,
and
- can/must be held in the UK (please note that the UK is back to being a full member of the horizon Europe programme).

Please check the page page for specific deadlines and  constraints which can change from year-to-year (this list is intended to be as stable as possible).
For example, for "early career" opportunities, a maximum of four years post-PhD is typical, though the details vary.
