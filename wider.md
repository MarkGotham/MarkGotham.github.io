## Wider Access and Benefit

Projects that most appeal to me are those that combine fundamental research with coherent plans for real, immediate, wider benefit.
Fortunately, corpus study and computational approaches to music are ready made for this synthesis.
This page highlights a few of the main projects and how I think that connection can work.

On this page:

- [Open Music Theory](#omt) textbook and data-driven anthology
- [Crowd-soured collections](#collections), e.g., of CC0 score transcriptions with "OpenScore"


## OMT

[Open Music Theory](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/)
is a free, born-digital, online textbook co-authored by several colleagues.
I have so enjoyed being in this OMT-team,
loved contributing (over 30 chapters),
and am gratified to know that ~1.5 million people have benefitted from it already in ~3 years.
This most directly connects with my research in the anthology section, notably:

These analysis corpora complement (and often benefit from) the score corpora described below.


## Collections

Since 2018 I've been driving projects create large collections of high-quality musical scores 
and release them freely
so that anyone can able to play, download, transpose and use as they please copyright-free (under a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license).

These project are in association with [OpenScore](https://openscore.cc/)
and to date to offer two major collections of lieder (songs) and string quartets.
